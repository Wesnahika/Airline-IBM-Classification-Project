# Airline IBM Regression Project

## Introduction

This project will include Exploratory data analysis and classification models to analyze the given data and attributes that can predict whether or not a plane will be delayed or on time.

To start this project, I will load in a couple of libraries as well via a Github url and the "read.csv" function.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
url<- "https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Wesnahika/Airline-IBM-Regression-Project/main/airline_2m.csv"
airline <- read.csv(url)
```
